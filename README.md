# pwbot
A simple bot for Perfect World 1.3.6 . 

Please keep in mind that this bot uses a very old bot technique (for exmaple, MHS-Bot-PW uses it), which was fixed a long time ago, so you won't be able to use it in modern Perfect World, only on some ancient custom servers. This program is just a backend, still needs GUI.

What's done:
- retrieving character info (HP, MP, Target, etc.) from client's memory
- composing moblist and saving it into file
- attacking mobs from moblist

TODO:
- GUI
- handle low HP, MP situations
- attempt to port it to newer Perfect World versions (the most difficult part)
